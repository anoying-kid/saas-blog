# Udemy

Most of us have heard of Udemy, especially high school and university students, it's already famous among them.

Udemy is the world's largest online educational platform, with over 185,000 courses and over 49 million students.

Millions of students have access to thousands of courses created by independent teachers thanks to them. Individuals and companies can access training courses through Udemy, which also offers a platform for professionals and teachers to upload their course materials.

# How does Udemy work?

The courses that Udemy offers assist students in improving their skills and preparing for professions. 

Academics and professionals in the field can sign up, create online courses on subjects or themes they are knowledgeable about, and sell them to registered professionals and students who are interested in learning. 

Udemy offers teachers a platform for instruction that includes tools for creating courses. They can produce and upload educational information and resources including recorded videos, audio clips, presentations, PDF papers, and folders. Through the platform's discussion board, instructors can communicate with students. 

You can access Udemy through their website or their app, which is available for download from Google Play or the App Store, where you can sign up, register for a course, learn at your own pace, and receive certificates proving you have completed it.

# WHAT COURSES DO UDEMY OFFER?

Udemy has over 185,000 online courses in a variety of languages ranging from business entrepreneurship to personal growth in technology and the arts.

## Udemy Courses

Udemy provides both free and paid courses; it is solely up to the instructor whether they want their course to be free or paid.

## Udemy Free Courses

One way instructors can test out teaching on our platform, grow a student following, and determine the demand for a topic is to make their courses available on the Udemy marketplace for free. It's an additional approach for teachers to get feedback from students on their teaching strategies.

## Difference between Free and Paid course

Students can study more easily thanks to the free courses available on Udemy. The features offered in a free course are more limited due to this simplified experience than in a paid course. 
For instance, no certificate of completion is provided for free courses. Even if they are allowed by the teacher, extra course features like the Q&A and direct messaging are excluded from free course enrollments.

# Advantages and Disadvantages of Udemy

As a MOOC(massive open online course) platform, Udemy categorises its courses into several groups, and each group is made up of several independent modules (videos, lesson notes, and assessment tests). 

The lessons are available for download so that the students can see or listen to the lectures at their own pace and convenience while they are offline. 

Although there are free courses available, access to the premium content requires payment. The lack of degrees or certifications offered by relevant accrediting authorities is one drawback of Udemy.
