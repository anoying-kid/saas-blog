# Best LMS Platform **Graphy**

Do you have a great idea for an online course? If so, you need to choose the best platform for building, marketing, and selling online courses so you can build a profitable knowledge business.

**Graphy** is a great online course creator. With it, you can create custom courses, build stunning no-code websites, and even launch your own app.

## Why Graphy over others?

* Graphy is used by over 30,000 creators. This is a powerful platform that will help you launch a successful online teaching business—even if you’re a first-time course creator.

* One of the top competitors to Graphy is Moodle. Moodle is the world’s most famous open-source learning management system. However, you generally need to have someone fairly tech-smart to set up and maintain Moodle. This means generally simple HTML coding ability and the ability to troubleshoot issues as needed.
Graphy, on the other hand, is a no-code website builder with numerous beautiful, user-friendly templates.

* Graphy is owned by an Unacademy group company. Unacademy is the largest online learning app in India and a major player in the edtech industry.

Most other LMS platforms charge a monthly fee plus a per-sale fee.
Graphy's pricing is simple and straightforward: a platform fee of 10% or ₹10 (whichever is greater) + a $19,999 onboarding fee is charged on every transaction and sale.

It will benefit new LMS platform users because they will not be charged extra if their sales are low, as users on other platforms are charged on 
a monthly basis.

Moreover, it offers a 14-day free trial period where you can practise using Graphy.

Credits are the name given to the created virtual currency that is gathered in the students' wallets. When students buy any course from the institute, they can use these credits to offset the cost.

Each student is assigned a unique referral code. These codes can be used by students to refer the course to someone else. When someone purchases the course using these referral codes, the student receives credit in his wallet.

## Graphy Alternatives

### MOODLE

Moodle is the world’s most famous open-source Learning Management System.

however this famous open-source LMS lost a considerable amount of its incredible potential for customization due to plugins and themes not being available for this type of installation.

### Kajabi

Kajabi LLC is an Irvine, California-based SaaS technology company that develops a platform for creators and entrepreneurs to create, market and sell digital content. The company is a tech unicorn, with a $2 billion valuation.

Affordability: Their plans are more expensive for those who are unfamiliar with this industry.

### Micosoft Teams

Microsoft Teams for Education: a platform that enables lectures, one-on-one and group discussions, and focused content work.An LMS like Canvas, Schoology, Blackboard, D2L—Brightspace , or Moodle: supports curriculum and class rosters.

Teams is a platform that students may well use in work, it is not great at tracking and managing a learning process.

## Should you use graphy?

The Graphy course platform offers excellent features at reasonable prices! It is more refined and tailored to Indian audiences, which is why you will find many Indian payment options, GST invoices, call support, and so on on this platform.

As a result, if your target audience is of Indian origin, you should definitely consider Graphy's Annual plan.

When comparing Graphy to its competitors, I would recommend Acadle only if you require webhooks and gamification features.

Graphy is a more established and promising tool with a promising future. Even though it is not as well-known as Thinkific or Teachable, it represents excellent value for money at the price point being offered.

You can definitely rely on this LMS platform now that it is supported by a reputable platform like **Unacademy!**

## Conclusion

With hundreds of impressive features, Graphy LMS appears to be a very affordable option for both novice and professional instructors and content creators.

It is especially appealing to Indian audiences because Graphy offers a variety of Indian payment options.
