# Meaning of LMS Platforms?

>A Learning Management System (LMS) platforms are a software application used to manage and deliver online learning content.

Using a learning management system, you can typically create and deliver content, track student involvement, and evaluate student performance.

Also, your student has access to interactive tools like discussion boards, video conferencing, and threaded conversations through a Learning Management System.

# Who can use the LMS platform and why?

An LMS platform is often used by businesses to train anybody and everyone who is seen as a member of their wider workforce, according to the corporate perspective.

* An LMS, for instance, could be used by a healthcare organisation to train its patient care support staff in customer service.

* An LMS may be used by a software corporation to train salespeople in product expertise and introduce training for recently announced features. 

* An LMS may be used by an on-demand IT company to provide resources to their service providers.

# An LMS platform feature

Different LMS platforms have different features that are designed to appeal to different user segments. A MOODLE LMS, for example, will differ from one designed for corporate training. 

A good LMS should have user-friendly features while also saving money. A company must select the right LMS to help it achieve its goals. 

The following are some key LMS features: 

* A central system into which all administrators and students can securely log in. 

* Profiles, certificates, and learning

* Automated assessment, test scoring, and performance evaluation based on learner behaviour. 

* The use of gamification to engage users and make learning more enjoyable.

* The system incorporates the API/xAPI LMS learning standard to facilitate content authoring and addition. 

* Features for event management and scheduling that guide learners through various learning paths.

* For instructor-led learning scenarios, webinars and live classroom functions are available. 

* It should be accessible; all users, including those with disabilities, should be able to use the system with ease. 

* Users can create profiles and connect with other peers through social capabilities. 

* It should have a responsive design and provide an excellent user experience. 

* It should have sophisticated tracking and reporting capabilities. 

* Technical assistance, which includes course development assistance. This is accomplished through lesson plans and built-in tutorials. 

* It should work in tandem with other software systems in your organisation.

# Types of LMS Platforms

## Self-hosted vs. Web-based

    LMS software can be installed locally or accessed via the cloud. Using your company's server, on-site programmes are installed on workplace computers. They provide excellent security and stable offline access, but they aren't nearly as flexible as cloud-based systems, which can be accessed from anywhere. 

    Additional benefits of cloud-based systems include automatic updates, support for third-party integrations, less maintenance, and greater scalability. They also typically have lower upfront costs. In contrast to the yearly licencing fee that many on-premise LMS solutions have, many vendors offer pay-as-you-go models.

## Open-source vs. Closed-source

    Open-source software (OSS) is distributed under a free licence. Anyone can access, customise, and distribute the code for free. Canvas, Moodle, and Sensei are popular examples of open-source LMS software. 

    Its counterpart, proprietary or closed-source software (CSS), has an encrypted code that external users cannot alter without a valid and authenticated licence. It can only be changed by the original owner or by users with access, such as hired engineers. Blackboard, Litmos, and TOPYX are examples of closed-source LMS programmes.

## Free vs. Commercial

    While it's important to keep your budget in mind, not all LMS software is expensive. Some solutions are completely free. Google Classroom and Schoology are both free to use and have numerous customization options. They're simple to customise to your specifications, especially if you have some tech-savvy developers on your team. 

    Some commercial LMS solutions, such as iSpring Learn and Open edX, provide free versions with limited functionality. You can try out the programme before upgrading to a paid version or paying for advanced features you may not require.

# What Is the Difference Between LMS and LXP? 

Both LMS and LXP (learning experience platforms) provide educational interfaces for learners. An LXP, on the other hand, allows learners to guide their learning process, whereas an LMS is administrator-centred, with content designed and arranged by instructors for learners. 

Both can be useful training methods. An LMS is the better option if your employees must meet strict, formal training goals, such as onboarding or compliance. Its learning process is built around your organization's predetermined outcomes.

An LXP continues to guide learners in developing necessary skills, but its methods are more dispersed. It uses AI to curate content from across the internet, taking into account factors from individual employee profiles such as training history, job requirements, and personal learning objectives. Going beyond a pre-built course library has the advantage of allowing learners to set their own pace.

## Final Thoughts

Choosing the best LMS platform is critical to your organization's success. Always know your requirements before choosing the best LMS software for your needs.

There are many other factors to consider when making a decision, such as whether or not the LMS you want to buy has the features you want, or if it will fit into your company's training budget.

The most important feature to look for is free trials. Look, you might not have time to find the perfect solution and implement it gradually. Some of you will be responsible for bringing an entire school district online in a matter of weeks. 

I recommend that you look for free trials because the best way to succeed after reviewing features and pricing is to bring the system online and test and tinker with it. Consider developing classes and resources. Assign a few people to the roles of teachers and students and observe how the system responds. If it becomes too irritating, move on to the next one and try again.
