Pros and Cons
Pros
Simple and intuitive interface
At first sight, Mailchimp's user interface is neat, straightforward, and welcoming. To generate eye-catching emails, drag and drop the email designer, edit it, and add your brand's touch.

Ideal for beginners
Mailchimp is perfect for those who are new to email marketing platforms due to its user-friendly interface and numerous connections. In addition, its "free" plan makes it a desirable starter package for newcomers.

Segmentation
The segmentation function in Mailchimp makes it simple to carry out basic audience segmentation. You may design more focused, accurate, and pertinent ads using their advanced segmentation capability based on a variety of combinations, including purchase activity, gender, age range, and more.

A/B testing
While the majority of email service providers provide A/B testing, Mailchimp's premium plans allow you to test numerous content variations. For instance, you can experiment with a different headline, image, and body copy combinations to discover which one resonates the most.

To determine which permutations and combinations generated clicks, Mailchimp offers a thorough evaluation of the performance of each combination.

Cons
Affordable, only in the short-term
Going with their free email newsletter plan as a new company or startup appears like an affordable choice because it provides the majority of the services for no additional cost.

However, when your company expands and you reach 2,000 contacts, you realise this strategy won't work for you anymore. forcing you to purchase an upgrade at a significant price premium. As previously indicated, the free option only functions with the Mailchimp logo at the bottom, which is undesirable for the majority of professional senders. Additionally, the free version's support is relatively restricted.

Limited automation features
Limited automation capabilities are provided by Mailchimp, which is a major letdown coming from a well-known email service provider like theirs.

Although it does include basic options like autoresponders and feedback emails, it cannot create bespoke automation or the kind of sophisticated segmentation that its rivals can.

Limited customer support
In comparison to other companies, Mailchimp's customer service is pretty inadequate. You only receive support via email for the first 30 days with the free email marketing plan.

Even though you have access to their Knowledge Base, there may be times when you need customer service, in which case you must upgrade to paid plans.

Up to the premium plan, there is still no phone assistance.

Mailchimp Alternative
Moosend
The first to go is Moosend! If you believe that Mailchimp can meet all of your needs but is a bit pricy, Moosend has got you covered!

The most advantageous aspect of Moosend is that you pay less for the same features. When you make the switch, a drag-and-drop email builder will appear that is simple for you to learn.

HubSpot
In addition to its simple drag-and-drop editor and adaptable templates, HubSpot is built to support your business growth with a wealth of optimization tools.

But when integrated with the CRM and marketing automation platform, HubSpot's marketing email tool truly shines.

With the aid of HubSpot, you are able to design intricate email campaigns that offer each contact a customised experience depending on the data you've gathered in the CRM.

Omnisend
It is targeted towards eCommerce enterprises, as opposed to Mailchimp, and has features that can help you increase sales while better understanding your subscribers and clients.

Using technologies like popups, user segmentation, and marketing automation, the technology aids retailers in better covering their eCommerce marketing funnel.

Additionally, Omnisend provides a complimentary subscription that permits customers to access all of its capabilities. The platform is mainly useful for small firms or larger businesses with extensive contact lists who wish to try the service without paying upfront because there is a limit of 250 contacts.

Is Mailchimp worth it?
If you're a startup or a small business with basic requirements, this is a great place to start. The software is ideal for sending out basic newsletters and automating basic tasks. You can also use it to build a simple but visually appealing website and host it on a Mailchimp domain.

Not to mention Mailchimp's free plan, which is quite good.

Overall, it's a very user-friendly platform, and the drag-and-drop email builder is simple to use. However, if your requirements are more complex, Mailchimp can quickly become an expensive platform.

Before deciding on a system, consider your needs and conduct a thorough analysis. This is a good option if you only need basic email sending capabilities. If you decide that Mailchimp is not the right platform for you, consider some Mailchimp alternatives such as Moosend, Hubspot, and Getresponse.
